## Description
This web application is a social media platform that allows users to post their deepest, innermost thoughts publically. Information is displayed to users in the form of a feed that stays up to date with the most recent thoughts at the top. As social media platforms grow in size and dexterity, it's often found enjoyble to find simpler, less crowded websites to use. To anticipate dealing with what may eventually turn out to be big data, the application uses MongoDB, a non-relational database, to organize data into documents and sub-documents, appropriately.

## Features
Once a user has created an account they can navigate to the homepage to make a new post or view recent posts. 

Users can also click on an individual post to view or make reactions on said post.

Users also have the ability to view their own profile as well as other user's profiles that include a list of friends and any posts that they have made.
